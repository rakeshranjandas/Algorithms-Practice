	First, colour the top edges of squares present at the top level i.e row 1. Squares[1,1] to [1,4]
		This can be done in 3^(n) ways. Where n = #columns

	Then, colour the left edges of the squares present on the left i.e col 1. Squares[1,1] to [5,1]
		This can be done in 3^(m) ways. Where m = #rows


	Then we plan to colour rest of the edges, starting from the [1,1]

	2 cases-

	Case 1: If the colors chosen are same

			Red
			 _
		Red	|_| ?

			 ?

		Then we have to choose "?" from {Black, Blue}. So 2 choices.


	Case 2: If the colors chosen are different

			Red
			 _
	   Blue |_| ?

			 ?

		Then from "?" we have to choose which edge has to be Red. The other will
		automatically be blue. 
		So 2 choices to choose which one should be Red.{right_edge, bottom_edge}.



	For painting all the top and left edges, we can do in 3^(m+n) ways.

	Remaining edges (bottom and right edge) of [1,1] can be painted in 2 ways.

	This makes 2 sides painted for [1,2]. This is reduced to above cases as we need to paint just
	2 sides of [1,2]. This can be done in 2 ways.

	....
	If we do this in a sequential fashion, then we only have to paint 2 edges of all the cells.
	This will arise in one of the 2 cases. Since both cases give 2 choices, we can paint all the
	m*n cells by 2^(m*n) ways.



	Total number of ways 
	= (Paint top and left) * (Paint rest of edges of all squares)
	= 3^(m+n)	*	2^(m*n)
